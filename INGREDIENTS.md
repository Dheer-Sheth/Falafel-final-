- Dried chickpeas: AVOID using canned chickpeas! Dried chickpeas (that have been soaked in water for 24 hours) are an important ingredient that will give your falafel the right consistency and taste. (Tip: I usually add about Â½ tsp of baking soda to the soaking water to help soften the dry chickpeas.)

- Fresh herbs: fresh parsley, cilantro, and dill are key to this authentic recipe.

- Onion: I typically use yellow onions, but white or red onions would work.

- Garlic: for best flavor, use fresh garlic cloves.

- Kosher salt and pepper: to taste.

- Spices: cumin, coriander, and a little cayenne pepper. Along with the fresh herbs, this trio of spices is what gives falafel it's bold authentic taste.

- Baking powder: this is what gives falafel an airy, fluffy texture (many recipes skip this, causing the falafel to come out too dense.)

- Sesame seeds: these are optional here, but I do like the added nuttiness.
